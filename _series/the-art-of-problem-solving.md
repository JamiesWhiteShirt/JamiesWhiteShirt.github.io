Modding is not always a walk in the park. You will always find a problem you don't know how to solve.
How should you find a solution to your problem? Can you figure out how resolve the problem on your own, or should you ask for help?
This series describes a general approaches to problem solving.

Problem solving is a big part of software development.
It involves a lot of trial-and-error, reducing problems into different problems or subproblems and lots of research.

### When problem solving your goals should be to:
- **Do your research. Solve the problem independently if you can.**
  Time is precious, and not everyone is helpful.
  The problem is yours, so it is expected of you to do what you can to solve it before you ask others.
  If your problem is very basic and you haven't done your research, you may be met with hostility.
- **Learn something along the way.**
  If your knowledge isn't up to speed, solving a problem is a great way to do something about it.
  When identifying an issue, you should learn _why_ it is an issue and _how the solution resolves it_.
  This way you may save time and learn how to avoid similar problems in the future.
